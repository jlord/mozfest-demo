# Mozfest Sheetsee Demo!

This is a simple demo of using creating a map from Google Spreadsheet data.

_It's built linking out to all libraries that it depends on, which isn't ideal -- especially since some of them are hosted from my S3 account. This is just for demo purposes and you can't count on those in real world situations :)_
